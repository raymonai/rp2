**TIP 1: PICK A COLOR PALETTE**

My #1 tip on what to wear for your family photos is to coordinate, not match. This goes for any family photo, not just holiday photos. Based on your personal taste, pick 2-3 colors that go well together(with at least one of them being a neutral color) and try to have each color shared between at least 2 outfits. For example, say you choose blue as your neutral base, add burgundy and cream as accent colors. In the above photo, do you see how the cream & burgundy occur in 2 outfits, and the blue denim ties it all together? And the olive sweater adds just a pop of color and interest, but goes beautifully with the whole palette. Mom did such an awesome job coordinating these outfits!

Here are just a few examples of color palettes that would look great for your holiday photos:

**TIP 2: DRESS IN LAYERS!**

Here in Portland, Oregon, fall and winter are the perfect time to dress in layers. Cable knits, chunky sweater over plain shirt, scarves or shawl for mom, cute hats, jackets- these are all wonderful options to add more texture, interest and style to your look.

**TIP 3: CONSIDER THE LOCATION OF YOUR HOLIDAY PHOTO**

When deciding what to wear for your holiday photos, the location of your photoshoot can also guide your choice of color palette. With the green background at a Christmas tree farm, neutrals look beautiful and are an elegant and classy look. If you like color, jewel tones like rust, deep reds, burgundy, green, etc can create a statement look when paired with neutrals. Just weave the color through all the outfits to tie them together without going overboard.

BONUS TIP! : If you haven’t got around to updating your family photos this year, and plan on framing these photos to display in your home, you may want to take that into consideration when deciding what to wear for your holiday photos. While festive holiday colors and matching holiday PJs are cute and work for holiday cards, it may not go with the colors in your home and it may not be something you want to look at all year round!
