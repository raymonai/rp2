 I am a Portland-based portrait and fine art photographer. I have always been a lover of Art in its various forms. Growing up, art projects was the one thing that could happily keep me up late into the night. In a family of mechanical engineers, I became the odd one out to pursue a Bachelors and Masters degree in Fine Arts.

Photography allows me to combine all my creative skills and abilities into creating a piece of art, capturing a piece of history and creating something beautiful and priceless. I believe in capturing authentic moments and am passionate about creating art featuring the people I photograph. Each time a client looks at a photograph that makes them smile, each time a photo brings back memories that melts their hearts and catches their breath, I am rewarded and know it was time well spent and my skills and abilities well used.

It is an honor to be let into people’s lives and capture interactions that make for endearing memories, encase fleeting life moments to make them last a lifetime and tell stories through pictures.

Other tidbits about me: I am drawn to people with a sense of humor, integrity and kindness. I am on a quest for the best red velvet cupcakes. Got recommendations?

NOTE: 100% proceeds from your sessions goes towards supporting a family and enriching the lives of two teenage boys – my own. (Hey, that doesn’t make a less noble cause!)

So THANK YOU for supporting and respecting my small business!
